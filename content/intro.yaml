      As of 4 weeks ago I am now ~fun-employed~, jk I didn't mean to say that. But the sentiment is true: I indeed do not have an employer and am hoping to have some fun.

      The question now is what do I intend to do?

      For a little back story, I'll go ahead and tell you what I've been telling my friends and myself, and if you are a friend then you already know:

      I recently moved back to the U.S. after living in London for 1.5 years. I left the company I was previously working for since they're based in the UK and this has brought me to my current free flowing state.

      My boyfriend has always dreamed of /planned to taking a year off to travel in his mid-twenties and I have decided to partake in this little adventure (and the start for me is right now! but with limited traveling of course). At first I was extremely uneasy about this - I've grown up learning from my parents the importance of a stable job and a steady income (classic Asian) and I shuddered at the thought of more money going out than coming in - living off of your savings by choice?! Who does that??

      Welp as it turns out, I do that. And despite having enough saved up to last a while without an actual income, I still feel insecure without one. In reality, what is one year without an income for me? It could potentially mean if I wanted to make a big purchase in the future (i.e. a house, a new car), I would probably have to buy it a year later than originally planned. It also could mean I would need to cut down on unnecessary clothing purchases and eat out less, cook more. And just overall be more aware of my day-to-day spendings. I know, these affects are pretty soft when I line them up like that. These effects differ from person to person and I'm fully aware that I am in a lucky situation. The point is, even on relatively stable ground, the fear of financial instability still causes internal anxiety and it's important for me to not be blinded by these premature fears. In actuality, a year without an income is not as daunting and unthinkable as I sometimes think it is, and that should give me temporarily relief from the financial stress we are constantly tied down to.

      Now that my financial fears are sorted, if I take a break from work, how will I advance in my career??!?!

      I have always viewed my twenties as my "learning" years - if I was going to have a period where I spend the most time and effort on work, this is it. No true obligations, no children dependent on me, and in my mind, a whole lot of energy that I can dedicate to learning. Most people in the same track of life as me probably share the same mindset here.

      But as I've left and began different post-college chapters, I've started to ask myself: what am I learning now, what am I trying to learn next, and is this the opportune time for it?

      More specifically: is another year in this environment going to teach me what I want to learn?

      Don’t get me wrong, I still want to keep learning from work, but in my head, I can easily keep learning work related content until I retire or die, which could literally be the next 50 years! What put this into more perspective for me was realizing that Joe Biden is going to be taking on what I believe is one of the most stressful jobs a human can have at 77 years old. 77!!!! If Joe can present his best self at 77, a year shaved off of work in my twenties seems pretty minimal. The road is long folks.

      Okay, then what do I want to learn next that’s not from work?

      In short, I want to gain a better understanding on what's happening in the "real world" - the world that we're living in that exists outside of my direct line of sight. While living in SF I had this feeling that I was living in a magical bubble, everything was stirring around me but my thoughts were consumed by my day-to-day movements: work, friends, eating,  repeat. When I moved to London I felt this sensation that the people around me were aware of what was going on around them (wars, revolutions, climate change, etc) perhaps it was the close proximity to neighboring countries or the mix of people from different cultures.  I suddenly felt like the issues that felt so far away before were so much closer and seeping into my little bubble. And I think this goes hand in hand with everything that has happened so far in 2020: the BLM movement, coronavirus, the 2020 elections etc. It feels like such a pivotal time for the world right now, so it doesn't feel like a bad time for some self reflection and a potential pivot.

      With all that backstory said, I'm hoping to start diving deeper into topics that are important to me. Some might be more serious and relevant, others more light hearted and personal, and I hope you will join me in the learning process on this site! This is my first time putting so many words out into the world, so please bare with me and hopefully it will be worthwhile. With everything that's going on, I truthfully don't know how long this break will last and if we will be able to fulfill our dream of spending a year traveling, but regardless, I hope to see some sights, experience a couple of golden moments and share some of my learnings along the way.
